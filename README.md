# Phylodynamic workflow for SARS-CoV-2

Collection of scripts used for performing bottom-up phylodynamic analysis. Starts with the data collected from [GISAID](https://www.gisaid.org) using [Augur](https://docs.nextstrain.org/projects/augur/en/stable/index.html) format.

The workflow includes subsampling, alignment, quality checking, computation of priors for BEAST analysis, up to visualizing the results.
